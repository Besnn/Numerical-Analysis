## Definition of Algorithm
> A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, 
can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal and that has a recognizable set of end conditions.
### To break it down:
* An algorithm consists of a number of *clear* (unambiguous) instructions.  
* These instructions, if executed, take *data* and produce *results* from them.   
* This execution will eventually terminate.
### Basic Requirements
An algorithm must satisfy two fundamental requirements for it to be considered an algorithm:
* Generality *(resolve a class of problems)*
* Optimality
## Horner's Method
### What it is and why it is important
Horner's Method (or Algorithm) is a method for evaluating polynomials.  
It is a very efficent. Why? The standard algebric way to evaluating polynomials looks something like this:
