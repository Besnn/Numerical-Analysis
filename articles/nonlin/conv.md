## Rate of Convergence
> The **rate of convergence** *(a.k.a. **order of convergence**)* of a method is a metric used to measure 
how quickly the sequence of solutions converges to a desirable value.  

A sequence is said to have an order of convergence `p` if the following holds true:

For `p = 1`, the order of convergence is **linear**; `p = 2` **quadratic** and so on.  
The constant `Î¼` is called *asymptotic error constant*.  

### Bisection Method
The **Method of Bisection** has a linear rate of convergence.

**Newton's Method**, on the other hand, has a quadratic rate of convergence:
